## How can I run this?
This app is configured to be deployed and managed via OpenShift.  Which means all you'll need to do is click a few buttons and specify some settings.  [Here is a link to a lab][5] that walks you through that process.

For more general instructions on OpenShift:
* If you are using OpenShift Online, [follow instructions here][1]
* If you have OpenShift Enterprise, [follow instructions here][2] 
* If you are using this as part of a Red Hat workshop, follow the provided instructions instead

## Notes
This lab code requires access to api.mapbox.com in order to run.
